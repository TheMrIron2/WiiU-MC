# WiiU-MC

WiiU-MC is a modification of WiiMC based on SuperrSonic's WiiMC-SS with Wii U in mind. 

# Installation

To install WiiU-MC on your Wii U, copy the "WUP-N-BOOT_000500029421FFE8" inside the wiiu directory onto your SD card and install it with WUP Installer.

# Encoding

Currently, WiiU-MC is not correctly harnessing the Wii U's hardware. As such, the best resolution to use without any framerate issues is 720x480, like a standard Wii. You may get away with up to 960x540 in some cases, such as a cartoon with low bitrate. WiiU-MC accepts h264 MP4s as well as DivX/XviD AVIs for video playback, and it also accepts MP3, MP4 and FLAC audio.

## WiiMC-SS features:
- Displays square pixels.
- Deflicker filtering has been disabled for best quality.
- Removed NTFS and EXT libs to increase memory.
- Attractive pointer.
- Removed grabbing textures.
